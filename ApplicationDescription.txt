All Hands Free

This is an Android app for letting you accept or reject calls without using your hands or even looking at the screen.
It runs quietly in the background and is triggered once the earphones are plugged in. 
When a call comes in while the earphones are plugged, the app reads you out the name of the person calling. 
You just have to utter a single word - yes or no, to accept or reject the call.
The app even provides you the luxury to blacklist the pestering callers.
